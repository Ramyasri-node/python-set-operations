# Python Set Operations

This project demonstrates basic **set operations** in Python.

## Operations Covered
- Union
- Intersection
- Difference
- Symmetric Difference

## Example Output
Union of E and N is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}  
Intersection of E and N is {2, 4, 6, 8}  
Difference of E and N is {0}  
Symmetric difference of E and N is {0, 1, 3, 5}

## Concepts Used
- Python sets
- Set operators: |, &, -, ^
